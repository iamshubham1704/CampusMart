### Sync Verified Payments Not Working

If the "Sync Verified Payments" functionality is not working, follow these troubleshooting steps:

#### 1. **Check Database Collections**
Use the new "üîç Debug Database" button to check:
- Total payment screenshots
- Number of verified payments
- Orders with payment screenshots
- Existing order statuses

#### 2. **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue: No verified payments found**
- **Cause**: Payment screenshots haven't been verified by admin
- **Solution**: Verify payment screenshots first in the payment verification section

**Issue: Missing related data**
- **Cause**: Buyer, seller, or product data is missing
- **Solution**: Ensure all users and products exist in their respective collections

**Issue: Database connection problems**
- **Cause**: MongoDB connection issues
- **Solution**: Check database connection and server status

**Issue: Permission errors**
- **Cause**: Admin token expired or invalid
- **Solution**: Re-login as admin to get fresh token

#### 3. **Debug Steps**

1. **Click "üîç Debug Database"** button
2. **Check console logs** for detailed error messages
3. **Verify payment status** in payment_screenshots collection
4. **Check order relationships** between payments and orders
5. **Validate data integrity** across collections

#### 4. **Manual Verification**

Check these collections manually:
```javascript
// Check verified payments
db.payment_screenshots.find({ status: "verified" })

// Check orders with payment screenshots
db.orders.find({ paymentScreenshotId: { $exists: true } })

// Check existing order statuses
db.order_status.find({})
```

#### 5. **Reset Sync State**

If needed, you can reset the sync state:
```javascript
// Remove all order statuses (be careful!)
db.order_status.deleteMany({})

// Then run sync again
```

#### 6. **Contact Support**

If issues persist:
- Check browser console for error messages
- Review server logs for backend errors
- Ensure all required collections exist
- Verify database permissions and connections
